# Compass Dark Mode Patch
This is a simple Greasemonkey script I make which changes the colours on Compass (https://www.compass.education/) so it has a dark mode theme, as it doesn't have one.
## Why did I create this script?
I created this script as we need to open Compass several times per day at school and I wanted it to be consistent with my OS and other tabs I have open.
I put this script online so that other people can enjoy consistent dark mode too.
## How to use
1. Install Greasemonkey if you don't already have it (You may need firefox which I normally use)
2. Open Compass
3. Create a new script by clicking the extension and selecting "New user script..."
4. Copy the contents of script.js into the new script you just created
5. Save the script by using Ctrl+S
6. Click the extension, then the newly created script, then "User script options", and then finally the little plus button under User includes.
   This will add <prefix>.compass.education into the box
7. Reload Compass
8. Enjoy

I will try to continue to add features to the script, such as making the colours on buttons and text better (in my opinion) or fixing the script if it breaks.
  
I can't garrantee it works (when it breaks it will usually just revert to light mode), particularly with different schools as they can have completely different layouts that may break the script.
